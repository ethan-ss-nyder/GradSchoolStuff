I am a first generation college student, raised in a large family that always wavered just above the poverty line. Because of this, I've never had financial support or a financial safety net, and have had to work part time throughout all of my undergrad experience. This resulted in limited time I could spare for research experiences, and made the time I could spare more stressful due to the tight schedule.
Halfway through my undergrad experience, I pivoted from astrophysics to focus on condensed matter physics, partly because of financial reasons, but mostly because I had an opportunity in WMU's Physics Department to assist in researching semiconductor defects and distortions. I also assisted in some lattice confinement fusion research utilizing WMU's particle accelerator, but it was the semiconductor research experience that changed the course of my life by exposing me to the world of condensed matter physics and computational research, both of which I want to continue exploring at Illinois.
During the summer of 2024, I was awarded a research scholarship that enabled me to dedicate more time towards this semiconductor research, and it turned into more of a personal guided project instead of research I was a passive part of. Ever since, I have been more involved with this research and it has truly transformed my perspective and motivations in physics, and I am eager to use this motivation to excel in graduate school.
