During my freshman year of undergrad, my parents went through a divorce that turned messy. In addition to being a full-time student and part-time worker, I had to make time to appear in court and help my family clean and move out of our childhood home, and handle family obligations --- all while commuting from home. That period from freshman into sophomore year forced me into adulthood all at once. I had to increase my work hours as I was thrust into complete independence because any financial safety net I’d had was gone.
This challenging period affected my grades as I had to prioritize family needs, and my full attention wasn’t always on my education. However, my transcript also reflects my resilience and persistence: my grades improved over time, I started taking summer courses and additional credits, and I expanded my academic ambitions. Once I emerged from this low point, I hit the ground running. I added a math major to my physics major, took on a computer science minor along with my astronomy minor, moved into an off-campus apartment, began assisting with Dr. O’Hara’s semiconductor research, and co-founded the Physics Club. My drive and motivation now ensure that I’ll bring full dedication to my studies and research at Illinois.
