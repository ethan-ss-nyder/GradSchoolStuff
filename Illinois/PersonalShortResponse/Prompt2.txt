During my sophomore year at WMU, I made my first physics major friend and we sought a larger community on campus. We discovered that, before COVID, there was an official Physics Club at WMU hosted in the physics major commons room, but it had not been registered in years. He and I registered Physics Club and spent weeks deep cleaning the commons, and we agreed that as co-founders, we would be co-presidents, and I assumed the extra tasks of being treasurer.
It wasn't until April 2024's solar eclipse trip that Physics Club gained traction, due to both general outreach and collaborating with Women in STEM and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). This was the first of many collaborations between this trio, the most recent being a trip to Fermilab led by the SHPE. Ever since these collaborations began, I've found that the physics commons room can now be somewhat loud during the day, and we now have members from these RSOs and the diversity of students, voices, and backgrounds in the physics commons is refreshing in contrast to the small city in the corn fields where I grew up.
The frequent collaboration made large, ambitious events possible, and developed a space where everyone's skills and perspectives contributed towards a goal. I've learned just how much people and their experiences can differ --- particularly in conversation with WMU's many international students --- and it's reinforced my belief that a diverse, inclusive environment always leads to richer, greater outcomes.
