\subsubsection*{Beyond Physics}
As a student, as a researcher, and as a person, I'm driven by an unstoppable motivation to pursue all that I'm passionate about. My first passion, astronomy, I was introduced to with a small plastic telescope, which I believe was when I first learned perserverence. This was also when I learned that I wanted to be a scientist.

Nowadays, I've narrowed that interest in science to condensed matter physics because of the many practical applications to modern life, although I still maintain the goal of being on the frontier of science. Over the years, I've found that I really enjoy computer science and coding, and knew that I needed that as part of my research going forward. During my time at Western Michigan University, I decided I'd turn my amateur, personal project expertise into a minor to solidify my coding skills, and I sought out computational research within the physics department to really flesh out my skills and interests. My choice to double major and double minor was to satisfy my passion for physics and mathematics, as well as satisfy my passion for computer science and its essential role in modern physics

As a student, as a researcher, and as a person, I'm driven by an unstoppable motivation and dedication to do what I love. For years now, I've given my undergraduate education twelve hour days, five days a week, no break during summers. However, I find it necessary to balance this by channeling my energy towards music, teaching myself acoustic guitar, and during (rare) clear night skies, I keep my astronomy equipment from gathering dust.

My desire to deeply engage with all my passions also led me to create a thriving community at Western Michigan University through Physics Club, a supportive environment for anyone who shares a love of physics, knowledge, and the natural world.
