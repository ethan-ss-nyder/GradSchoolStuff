Statement of purpose: In your statement of purpose, please address each of the 4 following categories: (1) Academic preparation & scholarly potential, (2) Research aptitude & problem-solving skills, (3) Alignment of your interests with our program, (4) Personal qualities and life experiences that will help you succeed in graduate school.

1. You do not need to repeat information from your transcript or CV, but you are encouraged to provide context to help interpret that information; e.g., your ranking in your academic program if known and meaningful; an explanation of why you took additional or more challenging courses than required; a description of growth from courses you found particularly challenging; or how a particular course contributed to the development of your research interests.

2. Summarize the experiences that have most influenced your research interests. Please tell us about research activities you conducted through course credits, thesis, and research programs you participated in, such as REU, SROP, Cal-Bridge, etc. Include details of your development as a researcher through these experiences. If you have overcome significant challenges in the course of your preparation, address these specifically.

3. Describe your reasons and motivations for pursuing a graduate degree in physics in general and as part of PSU specifically. What are your potential research interests and how do they relate to the programs, facilities and resources at PSU? If you are considering more than one subfield of interest, or are considering both theory and experiment, please tell us your enthusiasm level towards each option.

4. Please outline how you might positively contribute to the PSU Department of Physics as well as broader communities. You may describe examples of helping others around you through leadership, community involvement, and mentorship.

I decided to double major (physics and mathematics) and double minor (computer science and astronomy) because I wanted to have a deeper understanding and more confidence in math, and I wanted to develop my passion for computer science that I've previously developed on my own. Nearing the end of my undergraduate program, I am now a very well-rounded student and have thoroughly explored and incorporated all of my interests into my education. All of this combined has made me a more effective, capable computational and theoretical researcher, and has prepared me well for graduate school.
My higher level math, other than the required calculus courses, leans toward pure math rather than applied math, and has better equipped me to deal with topological concepts in condensed matter physics and exercised my skills in abstract math. My computer science minor has taken me above and beyond the computational skills of a typical physics major, and has taught me in-depth concepts that computational research experience doesn't quite reach.
Fitting all of this into my four years at Western Michigan University has been an exercise in time management and work ethic and has reassured me of my commitment to succeeding in physics. This same commitment assures my success in Penn State's physics graduate program.
