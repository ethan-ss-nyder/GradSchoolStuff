During my entire freshman year and most of my sophomore year, my family was recovering from a pretty extreme situation that resulted in the removal of my dad from my household (I lived at home and commuted at the time), the divorce of my parents, restraining orders, and a whole lot more difficulty involving pushing my dad from my life financially and legally. This further resulted in a long, nearly year long process of my family and I preparing our childhood home for sale, packing, moving, and spending time between houses.
At the time, I was also working 24 hours a week to support myself and try to keep the financial burden of college off of my mom and brothers as we were brought deeper into poverty. This all occurred while maintaining a full-time enrollment status at Western Michigan University, and kept me from being able to reasonably pursue summer courses to expand my education, something I did as soon as these external circumstances settled.
The time it took to handle these external matters, the commuting time (~40 mins each way), and the emotional toll made it very hard to feel present on campus and was absolutely the most stress I've been under in my life. My family as well as myself have never financially recovered from this event. Finances have since been even more strained, and without any help possible from my mom, I've had to rely on keeping up a part time job as well as hefty loans. It was also stressful figuring out financial aid, as my FAFSA had estimated my dad would help me through college a bit, which certainly did not happen.
Overall, this was an incredibly stressful situation and resulted in some poor performance freshman and parts of sophomore year. It's all gotten better now though! My mom is incredibly resilient and things have stabilized.
